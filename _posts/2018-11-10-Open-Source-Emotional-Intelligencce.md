<p>We are experts at information gathering when it comes to others and to our targets. In fact, most people are great at pointing out the flaws of others. But are you able to really analyze and learn about yourself? It's time to apply the concepts of Open-Source Information Gathering (OSINT) to ourselves and our emotional intelligence / self-knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Silence.</b> <i>We don't get much of it.</i> We are so overstimulated after staring at a screen all day, and code-switching between multiple disciplines. I like to allow my brain to just spin without adding anything else to the pile of overstimulation. I will give myself some period of time (often timed to keep myself from quitting quickly) where I just sit in silence, without analyzing the day or really trying to think at all, just letting my own thoughts continue to spin until they stop spinning. Often I will simply turn of the radio in the car for some period of time. Sometimes I'll talk aloud, or sometimes I'll just sit.</p>

<p><b>Embrace Awkward.</b> Too often we run away from things that cause us discomfort. By embracing these moments (gradually, as this takes practice), we can learn more about ourselves. Additionally, we can start to see things coming before they smack us in the face. How many people can you think of that have been shocked when their marriage has come to a screeching (and explosive) halt, but everyone around them saw it from 3 miles away? Try to actually give yourself time to think about your circumstance, and don't just carry on with the status quo. But sometimes it's hard to look in at our lives as an outsider, so that brings me to...</p>

<p><b>Seek Criticism.</b> If you're having a problem figuring out why you keep hitting the same roadblocks, try to seek <i>wise</i> counsel. The word "<i>wise</i>" there is important. Pick someone who's opinion you trust. If you disagree with their assessment, don't immediately dismiss it. Try to parse it through with them, attempting to understand. If you find yourself getting angry at their opinion, maybe walk away and figure out why that is. They may not be 100% correct, but chances are if they have this opinion they have it for a reason.</p>

<p><b>Why am I annoyed at them?</b> A lot of time when we can't stand someone else, it's because we're projecting something that we do and aren't ready to deal with ourselves. Before you jump out and get accused of being the "pot calling the kettle black", maybe think for a moment and see if you do that thing yourself. Why are you so frustrated that someone else does something that you do? Work on yourself first, others will figure themselves out.</p>

<p>I believe this is an extremely timely topic for the InfoSec community. I have witnessed a large amount of burnout, and unacknowledged mental health issues. Additionally, I have seen an increase of conference speakers touch on emotional health and self-knowledge, but not fully dive into it. Let's work towards the (gradual) de-stigmatization of mental health issues in our community, and encourage individuals to work on themselves, or to get help if needed.</p>
